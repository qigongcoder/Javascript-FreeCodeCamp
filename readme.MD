## 1 Easy Challenges
### Functional Programming

*'Functional Programming is another popular approach to software development. In Functional Programming, code is organized into smaller, basic functions that can be combined to build complex programs.*

*In this course, you'll learn the core concepts of Functional Programming including pure functions, how to avoid mutations, and how to write cleaner code with methods like .map() and .filter().'*



## 2 Intermediate Challenges
### Algorithm Scripting Challenges

*'Now that you know the basics of algorithmic thinking and Functional Programming, test your skills with the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges.'*



## 3 Certificate Challenges
### Algorithms and Data Structures Projects
 

*'This is it — time to put your new JavaScript skills to work. These projects are similar to the algorithm scripting challenges you've done before – just much more difficult.*

*Complete these 5 JavaScript projects to earn the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification.'*
